# Introduction to R

A short and informal introduction to R for our colleagues at UO. This repo contains two sections.

  1. [**R intro**](https://rawgit.com/grantmcdermott/R-intro/master/rIntro.html). Really, an R intro aimed at Stata users.
  2. [**Regression intro**](https://rawgit.com/grantmcdermott/R-intro/master/regression-intro.html). The "bare minimum" that an applied economist would probably want to know about, from basic regression syntax to clustered standard errors.
